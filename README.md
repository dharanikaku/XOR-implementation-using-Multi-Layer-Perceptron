# XOR-implementation-using-Multi-Layer-Perceptron
Here we have the implementation of functionality of two input XOR, using multi layer perception.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (online i.e taking one sample at a time) is considered.
The entire process can be divided into two process.
They are: 1) Forward Propagation 2) Backward Propagation.
Now, at the end one can find the number or fraction of correctly classified samples to know how good the weights are updated.
